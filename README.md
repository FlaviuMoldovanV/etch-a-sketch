It's a prototype of an etch-a-sketch which creates a grid of squares when the user clicks a button. After that it prompts the user to input the grid size, and if the input is a valid number, it dynamically generates the grid with the specified number of rows and columns. When the user hovers over the grid squares with the mouse, they turn black, creating a simple drawing effect.
